# Jonah 

I am a Computer Science Student at the University of Michigan with a minor in Mathematics.
I enjoy finding creative ways to build efficient, reliable systems and solve logical problems.

Currently, I'm working in Professor Karem Sakallah's formal verifications research lab. I use Python and Ivy to develop automated verification methods, which prove the correctness of distributed protocols. By applying mathematical symmetry analysis, I help reduce the manual effort required to ensure system reliability.

Other projects I've worked on include the autonomy software for the Michigan Mars Rover Team. I have also developed a full-stack instagram clone.

When I'm not coding, I serve as president of the Hillel Outdoor Adventure Club, where I lead meetings and plan outdoor events for dozens of students.
