I joined Professor Karem Sakallah's research lab in the summer of 2025. While it may be the most abstract and complicated topic I've ever worked with, it is also one of the most fascinating. As a formal methods research lab, our main goal was proving the correctness of protocols of distributed systems. We used Ivy to model and specify the protocols, while we used Python for the analysis and verification algorithms.
